# WeCodePropertiesScala

Welcome to the Scala implementation of WeCodeFest's property based testing workshop.

## Working with the project

The most important thing you'll want to do with this project is just running the tests. To do so, you just have to execute:

```
sbt test
```

## Branches:

This project contains a few branches in order to help you with irrelevant implementation details that could be time consuming but don't add any value to this Workshop.  

### Project scafolding:
Just a simple scafolding of a Scala project in order to run the tests 

```
git checkout scafolding
```

### Sum properties:
In this branch, you'll find the definition of each test we'll need to implement in order to test a sum
```
git checkout sum-properties
```
In case you want solved exercises:
```
git checkout sum-properties-solved
```
